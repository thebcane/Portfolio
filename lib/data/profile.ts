  bio: [
    "I'm Brendan—a multi-award-winning audio engineer from Toronto who's spent the last 10+ years turning noise into storytelling across immersive sound design, music production, and interactive media.",
    "As Head Audio Engineer at Ballen Studios, I mixed and mastered 300+ episodes of award-winning content that made history in November 2024 when we earned a Golden Globe nomination for our immersive storytelling—becoming one of the first podcasts ever nominated—and won multiple Webby Awards, reaching over 2.8 billion listeners worldwide. My work spans music production with Disney Channel, Warner Records, and Universal Music, creative direction for Amazon multimedia projects, and extensive 3D scene/environment design and cinematography for commercial promotions.",
    "I combine deep technical expertise with creative vision, specializing in cinematic audio production, spatial sound design, and adaptive audio systems. I graduated at the top of my class from Metalworks Institute and continue to push the boundaries of immersive storytelling through sound, regardless of the medium.",
